Hi there! 

I'm Santhoshini, currently finishing up my Master's at [CMU SCS](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) (Dec '25). I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering and research to make intelligent systems practical and scalable.

I'm collaborating with the [Momentum Robotics Lab](https://github.com/momentum-robotics-lab) with [Prof. Jeff Ichnowski](https://ichnow.ski/) and [Bart](https://www.bart-ai.com/), adapting 3D foundational models (VGGT, Mast3R) for single-task diffusion policies and generalist vision–language–action policies. I also focus on making large models compute-efficient, leading projects in 1D image tokenization to accelerate latent diffusion and mixed-precision patch attention for vision transformers(wip).

During Summer ’25, I interned at [Plus.ai](https://plus.ai/) as a Perception Research Engineer Intern, where I worked on multimodal sensor fusion for BEV segmentation. Previously, I spent time as graduate researcher at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U9dH-DoAAAAJ&hl=en), working on Seq2Seq modeling problems like handwriting recognition and zero-shot text to image retrieval. I also worked at [Micron Technology](https://www.micron.com/) as Applied ML Engieer developing few-shot instance segmentation models over cloud platforms. 

*I’m excited to join teams that rely on generalists to bridge research and scalable implementation. Please feel free to reach out!*
