## About Me
Iâ€™m Santhoshini, a graduate student majoring in Computer Vision at CMU. Here, I'm working at the [Momemtum Robotics Lab](https://github.com/momentum-robotics-lab) with [Prof. Jeff Ichnowski](https://ichnow.ski/) on improving 3D vision models for robotic perception. I'm also exploring areas like scaling generative modeling, with one of ideas being to improve image tokenization. 


Previously, I was a full-time graduate researcher at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U9dH-DoAAAAJ&hl=en), where I focused on handwriting recognition for Indian languages in document understanding. My work involved improving Seq2Seq models, enhancing image and text encoders for multimodal representation learning, and developing an embedding-based search engine.
