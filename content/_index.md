## About Me
Iâ€™m Santhoshini, a graduate student majoring in Computer Vision at CMU. Here, I'm working at the [Momemtum Robotics Lab](https://github.com/momentum-robotics-lab) with [Prof. Jeff Ichnowski](https://ichnow.ski/) on improving 3D vision models for robotic perception. I'm also exploring areas like scaling generative modeling, with one of ideas being to improve image tokenization. 


Previously, I was a full-time graduate researcher at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U9dH-DoAAAAJ&hl=en), where I focused on handwriting recognition for Indian languages in document understanding. My work involved improving Seq2Seq models, enhancing image and text encoders for multimodal representation learning, and developing an embedding-based search engine. 

### Featured Projects
- **[Real-time 3D Scene Reconstruction](content/imtok.md)**

This work aims to create cheap and efficient vision systems that can rapidly reconstruct dynamic 3D environments to improve robot decision-making for manipulation. Opitizing 3D geomertic models like Dust3r to work for multi-view and dynamic motion settings. 

- **[Language-guided image tokenization](content/mast3r.md)**
This project aims to improve comression ratio by using language guidance in ViT-based image tokenizers. The goal is to evaluate and explore multimodal interactions needed between language and images needed for tokenization.

- **[360 Panorama Generation](https://github.com/example/project2)** 
Image synthesis of real-world 360 panorama images using 3D object generation and placement.

- **[HWSearch](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/hw-search)** 
A zero-shot search engine for handwritten collections.
