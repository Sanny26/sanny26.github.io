Hi there! 

I'm Santhoshini, currently finishing up my Master's at [CMU SCS](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) (Dec '25).  

I'm working at the [Momentum Robotics Lab](https://github.com/momentum-robotics-lab) with [Prof. Jeff Ichnowski](https://ichnow.ski/) and [Bart](https://www.bart-ai.com/), focusing on 3D reconstruction and object completion priors for VLAs in robotics

During Summer ’25, I interned at [Plus.ai](https://plus.ai/) as a Perception Research Engineer Intern, where I worked on multimodal sensor fusion for BEV segmentation. Previously, I spent time as graduate researcher at [CVIT, IIIT Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) under the guidance of [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=U9dH-DoAAAAJ&hl=en), improving handwriting recognition and image search for Indic scripts. I also worked at [Micron Technology](https://www.micron.com/) as Applied Scientist developing few-shot instance segmentation models.

My current interest is: 
**Scaling post-training and inferencing of large models like VLMs or LMMs** for real-world applications such as robotics, personalized content generation on phones and wearable devices.
