## Project Overview

3D foundational models like DUSt3R have revolutionized real-time scene reconstruction, offering significant advantages for applications such as scene rendering, AR/VR streaming, and robotic learning. DUSt3R (Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction) enables 3D reconstruction without requiring predefined camera poses or intrinsic parameters, streamlining the process and enhancing efficiency.  ï¿¼

## Research Objectives

{{< icon "linkedin" "1.2em" "mr-2" >}} In our project, we aim to leverage these scene representations to enhance manipulation policies. Recent advancements, such as the FP3 modelâ€”a large-scale 3D foundation policy for robotic manipulationâ€”demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D policies across various manipulation tasks. 

Our objective is to harness pretrained foundational models within a rapid and cost-effective optimization framework, further advancing the application of 3D scene representations in robotic learning. This approach aligns with the growing trend of integrating 3D geometric information into robotic systems to enhance performance and adaptability.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Challenges

Additionally, optimizing the 3D perception pipeline to reduce latency and improve accuracy is crucial for effective scene representation. Addressing these challenges is essential for the seamless integration of 3D perception in real-world robotic applications.
